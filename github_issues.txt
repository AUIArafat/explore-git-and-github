Issues are a great way to keep track of tasks, enhancements, and bugs for your projects. 
They're kind of like emailâ€”except they can be shared and discussed with the rest of your team. 
Most software projects have a bug tracker of some kind. GitHub's tracker is called Issues, and 
has its own section in every repository.
